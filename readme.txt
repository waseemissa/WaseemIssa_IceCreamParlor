******************* The Ice Cream Parlor Problem *******************

This function takes as parameters the amount of money that two friends have and 
an array of the costs of different kinds of ice cream. It iterates over the costs, 
then returns an array containing the cost of two ice cream kinds that they can 
pay for in ascending order.

I solved this exercise using two approaches: using two for loops and using 
one for loop with one while loop.
